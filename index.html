                <h2>About ROLEX</h2>
                <p>Rolex is one of the most prestigious and recognized luxury watch brands globally, known for its exceptional craftsmanship, durability, and timeless design. The brand was founded in 1905 by Hans Wilsdorf and Alfred Davis in London, originally under the name "Wilsdorf and Davis." In 1908, the brand name "Rolex" was registered, and by 1919, the company had moved its headquarters to Geneva, Switzerland.</p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Hans Wilsdorf was born in Kulmbach, Bavaria,[2] to Protestant parents, Anna and Johan Daniel Ferdinand Wilsdorf and was the second son of a family of three children.
                    The photo above shows Hans Wilsdorf (front row right) standing in front of his father, with his mother sitting down between his sister and brother.
                    His mother died when he was a boy and he became an orphan when his father died soon after when Hans was twelve years old.
                    Wilsdorf's fate was placed in the hands of his uncles who sold the prosperous family iron tools business which had belonged to his grandfather, and later to his father. Hans and his brother and sister were sent to excellent boarding schools where they received excellent educations.</p>
